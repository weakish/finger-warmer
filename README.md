Personal AutoHotKey scripts I use.

If not specified, scripts are written by me.
Most of them are trivial, though.

AutoHotKey scrips:

- DragKing: automatically copy selection.
- dvorak.ahk: change keyboard to dvorak. (I use registry entries for this on my machine. It can be used when using other people's machine.)
- windows-manager: some shortcuts inspired from wmii/awesome/xmonad. (I have no longer used this. I ues [PWT][] now.)
- switch-esc-caps: switch Esc and CapsLock 

[PWT]: https://github.com/Tzbob/python-windows-tiler/

Other stuff:

- dvorak-reg: registry entries to switch between qwerty and dvorak
- clip.exe: Ships in Windows 2003 server, Windows Vista and Windows 7 but not in Windows XP. (But it works under Windows XP.)
